Welcome! My name is Elena Callus and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Gärttner group](https://qiqs-jena.de) at Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, Germany. 

My main research interests are quantum information theory, continuous-variable quantum computing and quantum resource theories. I have previously worked on applications of light--matter interaction in entanglement-generation and quantum error correction. Currently, I am working on characterisation of entanglement in continuous-variable systems by means of phase-space distributions.
