  abstract = {The efficient witnessing and certification of entanglement is necessitated by its ubiquitous use in various aspects of quantum technologies. In the case of continuous-variable bipartite systems, the Shchukin--Vogel hierarchy gives necessary conditions for separability in terms of moments of the mode operators. In this work, we derive mode-operator-based witnesses for continuous-variable bipartite entanglement relying on the interference of two states. Specifically, we show how one can access higher moments of the mode operators, crucial for detecting entanglement of non-Gaussian states, using a single beamsplitter with variable phase and photon-number-resolving detectors. We demonstrate that the use of an entangled state paired with a suitable reference state is sufficient to detect entanglement in, e.g., two-mode squeezed vacuum, NOON states, and mixed entangled cat states. We also take into account experimental noise, including photon loss and detection inefficiency, as well as finite measurement statistics.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate how to create maximal entanglement between two qubits that are encoded in two spectrally distinct solid-state quantum emitters embedded in a waveguide interferometer. The optical probe is provided by readily accessible squeezed light, generated by parametric down-conversion. By continuously illuminating the emitters, the photon scattering and incremental path-erasure builds up entanglement. Our method does not require perfectly identical emitters, and accommodates spectral variations due to the fabrication process. Furthermore, for some line-width and energy ratios, the entanglement build-up can be significantly faster than for more similar emitters. It is also robust enough to create entanglement with a concurrence above 99% in the event of scattering losses and detector inefficiencies, and can form the basis for practical entangled networks.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate that the spin state of solid-state emitters inside micropillar cavities can serve as measure qubits in syndrome measurements. The photons, acting as data qubits, interact with the spin state in the microcavity and the total state of the system evolves conditionally due to the resulting circular birefringence. By performing a quantum non-demolition measurement on the spin state, the syndrome of the optical state can be obtained. Furthermore, due to the symmetry of the interaction, we can alternatively choose to employ the optical states as measure qubits. This protocol can be adapted to various resource requirements, including spectral discrepancies between the data qubits and codes with modified connectivities, by considering entangled measure qubits. Finally, we show that spin-systems with dissimilar characteristic energies can still be entangled with high levels of fidelity and tolerance to cavity losses in the strong coupling regime.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
